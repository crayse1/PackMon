Title: PackMon.NET / Sniffer.NET (Latest By 5 Oct 2005)
Description: An update to my award winning Sniffer.Net which use my Sniffer.Net Library. I have included support for viewwing the contents of the packet by double clicking any packet from the list view. PackMon was my very first attempt of making a Network Packet Capturing tool in .NET i have created similar tools in vb6 using winpcap library. but this time i have created my own library in .NET which can monitor all network traffic. PackMon.NET is a .NET library is inspired by a similar code from http://www.mentalis.org/ their code was a great help for me i have converted some parts exactly the same from C#.Net to VB.Net but most of the code is entirely written by me. please give me Globes if you really like this code. you can use the library and provided sample application that use the library but please do give me credit for the same. This is still a beta version and i thought that together we can make it a really big and powerful project.
This time also i need support from you guys to help make this a really big success. i want to make it plugin based so that as one of user suggested we might use it as Firewall or bandwidth monitoring tool... there is so much that can be done with this but the next big update would be general purpose plugins plus editing the contents of the packet before sending to the target machine.
